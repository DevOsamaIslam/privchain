# Privchain

## Private blockchain written in typescript (in progress)

## Notes

    Transactions: This implementation is missing some important features such as checking if the ring size is valid. Also, in real-world implementation, it is important to use a more secure way to store private keys and use a more secure signature algorithm.

Here are a few ways to improve the RingMember class for secure blockchain transactions:

    Use a more secure way to store private keys: Instead of storing the private key as a plain string, it should be encrypted using a secure encryption algorithm such as AES and a strong password.

    Use a more secure signature algorithm: Instead of using the secp256k1 elliptic curve algorithm, you can use a more secure algorithm such as ed25519 or p256.

    Validate the private key: Before creating a key pair, you can validate the private key to make sure it's a valid hexadecimal string of the correct length and format, and that it corresponds to a valid public key.

    Use a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to generate a key from the password: When storing the private key, you can use a KDF to derive a key from the password and use that key to encrypt the private key.

    Use Secure Random Number Generation (SRNG) for key generation: When generating the key pair, use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to ensure that the private key is truly random and not predictable.

    Use a hardware security module (HSM) to store the private key : A hardware security module (HSM) is a secure device for storing and managing digital keys. HSMs provide a higher level of security than software alone and can protect against physical attacks.

    Use a multi-sig mechanism: A multi-sig mechanism is a way of ensuring that multiple people need to sign off on a transaction before it can be processed. It can be used to increase security and prevent unauthorized transactions.

    It's worth noting that the implementation of these features can be complex, and it's important to work with experts in the field to ensure that your implementation is both secure and performant.
